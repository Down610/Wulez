### About Wulez
Wulez is a project of Catalogue and SWF, totally based on the original servers of the Habbo [BR](https://habbo.com.br/)/[EN](https://habbo.com/), with the intention of providing to those who use, the best of the original content, without errors and mistranslations, thus having everything fully functional and of the best quality.

> Project started in 1th November 2018.

> Currently for Arcturus 1.16.

> Currently only the English version will be available and worked, soon other languages.

*It is a free and open source project, you can make changes to your server on your computer.*

> *Note: SWF archives are separated, will only be released on another platform(mega.nz), once the whole swf is ready and up-to-date.*
