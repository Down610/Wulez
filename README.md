### About Wulez

Started in 1th, November 2016, Wulez is a project of Catalogue and SWF, totally based on the original servers of the Habbo [EN](https://habbo.com/), with the intention of providing to those who use, the best of the original content, without errors, thus having everything fully functional and of the best quality, other languages are plans for a future, a near future.

> Last update: *Wulez r3 PRIDE Edition* soon.

### Custom WIREDS

By a small slip of mine, I did not add some missing things in r2, so I temporarily separated.

> This is temporary, it will be back on r3.
