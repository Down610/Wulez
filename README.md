### About Wulez
Wulez is a project of Catalogue and SWF, totally based on the original servers of the Habbo [BR](https://habbo.com.br/)/[EN](https://habbo.com/), with the intention of providing to those who use, the best of the original content, without errors and mistranslations, thus having everything fully functional and of the best quality. **No custom furniture will be added to the project**, only the custom Wireds, that are of the emulator, since Wulez is a project totally turned towards Arcturus Emulator.

> Project started in 1th November 2018

*It is a free and open source project, you can make changes to your server on your computer.*
